# Project: Around the US Social Network

This project is a social network that has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. REST APIs have been used to interact with the server, and the BEM methodology has been applied to both file structure and class naming. The project also utilizes the Webpack bundler to manage dependencies and optimize the code.

## Key Features

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** The project has been developed using standard web programming languages: HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for client-side logic.
- **REST APIs:** REST APIs have been used to interact with the server and perform read, write, update, and delete operations on the social network's database.
- **Components:** The code has been divided into reusable components, making maintenance and scalability of the project easier.
- **BEM Methodology:** The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology has been applied to class naming, ensuring more readable and structured code.
- **JavaScript Object and Class Management:** The project utilizes JavaScript objects and classes to represent relevant entities of the social network, such as users, posts, comments, etc.
- **Active Validations:** Active validations have been implemented for all form fields. This means that real-time checks are performed to ensure that user-entered data is correct and meets the specified requirements.
- **Webpack:** The project utilizes the Webpack bundler to manage dependencies and optimize the code. Webpack allows for code splitting into modules, facilitating development and maintenance of the project.
